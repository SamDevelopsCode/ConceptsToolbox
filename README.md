Technologies: Godot Engine \
Languages: C#

An application I built using C# in the Godot Engine which is a toolbox of concepts to help visualize what tools C# offers us as developers, to solve problems.

My main inspiration for this project stems from working in construction for a number of years. Every day I got to see and physically choose my tools for the particular job I was working on. I feel this could be beneficial for people unfamiliar with a langauge who want a sort of quick and dirty interactive cheatsheet. Yes, you can read the docs on any particular language or framework but there is usually an abundance of information to parse through to see the actual toolset and features. I wanted to emulate the ability of being able to see the tools, pick them up (read about them or copy basic templates) and use them quickly. I then had the thought of "Why not use C# to build the toolbox application as well."

You can click on a sidebar and choose what I call a **tool**, which is just my fancy way of referencing any particular concept then read about the basics of it, and copy from small code snippets if you want to.
